> **"Every friendship is an edge. Every person is a node. But not all nodes are equal."**
>
> This project applies **Graph Theory** and **Network Science** to a real-world classroom dataset — mapping social bonds, detecting hidden communities, and identifying the students who hold the network together.

---

## 🧠 What This Project Does

Given a real dataset of friendships within a college classroom, this notebook constructs and analyzes a **social graph** to answer questions that no survey or spreadsheet could:

- Who is the **most influential** person in the room?
- Which students act as **bridges** between otherwise disconnected groups?
- What **hidden communities** exist beneath the surface?
- How does information **flow** through the class?

---

## 📊 Key Findings at a Glance

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| **Nodes (Students)** | ~35+ | Full class representation |
| **Edges (Friendships)** | Multiple | All unique, undirected connections |
| **Network Density** | **0.23** | 23% of all possible friendships exist — realistic & healthy |
| **Graph Diameter** | **4** | Any two students are ≤ 4 hops apart (*Small World Effect* ✅) |
| **Avg. Clustering Coeff.** | **~0.59** | If A is friends with B & C → 59% chance B & C are also friends |
| **Isolated Students** | **0** | Every student has at least one connection |

## 🏆 Who Runs The Room? — Centrality Rankings

### 🥇 Degree Centrality *(Most Popular)*
**ARUSH RANJAN** — directly connected to ~**57%** of the class. The drop-off to the next student (~40%) reveals a **centralized, hub-and-spoke** structure rather than a distributed one.

### 🥇 Betweenness Centrality *(The Gatekeeper)*
**SIDDHESH BANSAL** — despite not being the most popular, he sits on the shortest path between more pairs than anyone else. He is a **critical information broker** bridging distinct social circles.

### 🥇 Closeness Centrality *(Fastest Information Spreader)*
**ARUSH RANJAN & BANOTU SANTHOSH** — positioned at the geometric center of the graph. A rumor starting with them reaches everyone with the fewest hops.

## 👥 Community Detection — 5 Distinct Social Circles

Using the **Girvan-Newman Divisive Clustering** algorithm (which outperformed Greedy Modularity for this dataset):

| Community | Identity | Binding Factor |
|---|---|---|
| 🟠 **Orange** | "The South Cluster" | Regional / geographic origin |
| 🟣 **Purple** | "The Hostel Cluster" | Residential proximity (hostel wing) |
| 🔵 **Blue** | "The Female Cluster" | Gender-based social cohesion |
| 🟢 **Green** | Sub-community | Mixed ties |
| 🔴 **Red** | Sub-community | Mixed ties |

> **Key Insight:** Social circles form primarily around **residence** (hostel wing) and **regional origin**, not academic performance or class seating — mirroring real-world sociological findings.

---

## 🌉 Network Bridges — The Students Who Hold It All Together

| Student | Function | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|
| **Badagoni Sri Sahasra** | Connects the Female Cluster → South Cluster via Arush Ranjan | Prevents the structural isolation of the Female Cluster |
| **Madan Vishwakarma** | Bridges the Hostel Cluster ↔ South Cluster | Enables cross-group information flow between the two dominant subgroups |

> Remove these students from the graph, and the network **fractures**. They are structurally irreplaceable.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations & Critical Reflections

This analysis acknowledges its own blind spots — because good data science always does:

1. **Overlapping Group Problem** — Girvan-Newman forces hard community boundaries. Real students can belong to multiple circles simultaneously (e.g., South Indian + Hostel resident).
2. **Static Snapshot** — Social networks evolve. This is a single point-in-time capture; friendship ties form and dissolve.
3. **Self-Reported Bias** — The source data reflects *perceived* friendships, not necessarily *mutual* ones.
4. **Undirected Graph Assumption** — All edges are treated as bidirectional, which may not always reflect reality.

## 🔮 Future Scope

- [ ] Build a **directed graph** to model asymmetric friendships (A considers B a friend, but not vice versa)
- [ ] Apply **temporal analysis** — how does the network change over a semester?
- [ ] Use **overlapping community detection** (e.g., BIGCLAM) to handle students belonging to multiple groups
- [ ] Build an **interactive visualization** using Gephi or Pyvis
